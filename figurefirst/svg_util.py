    instances of the string 'search_string' with the 
    unique string 'prefix_x'.

    Parameters
    ----------
    in_filename : name of the file to parse

    out_filename : name of the file to write. If 
        out_filename is the same as in_filename
        then the old document will be overwritten.

    search_string : target string to search and replace. Note: 
        when applying this function to svg layout documents
        take care that you don't target strings that are 
        common strings in the SVG language. e.g. 'label'

    prefix : the prefix will be appended with a number and used
        to replace each occurance of the search string.
